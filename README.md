# Cabs-Price-Prediction
## Description:
This project aims to investigate different machine learning algorithms for a regression task and operationalizing it.
## Index
1. Feature Selection: Boruta technique has been used to select only useful features in predicting the price of a cab
2. Employed various Machine learning Algorithms to know which has the best predictive power using Azure ML Studio
3. Deployed the Machine Learning model using Azure ML Web services
